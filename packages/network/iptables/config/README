To create your own set of Netfilters you can save your rules in:
/storage/.config/iptables/localrules.v4 for ipv4
and /storage/.config/iptables/localrules.v6 for ipv6

You can alter tables and save them with:

iptables-save /storage/.config/iptables/localrules.v4
and/or
ip6tables-save /storage/.config/iptables/localrules.v6

If you want to disable iptables systemd service you can use 
the following command:
systemctl mask iptables

to enable:
systemctl unmask iptables
